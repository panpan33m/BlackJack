# BlackJack

Blackjack (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackjack) is one of the simplest casino card games. 
The goal of the game is to get cards in your hand that come as close to 21 as possible without going over. 
The Blackjack Game will allow you to play Blackjack against a dealer, run by the computer.  
The program will allow you to play with up to 5 decks of cards. 
The set of decks will be shuffled when the program starts. 
The cards are then dealt one at a time to the player and to the dealer. 
The player has the option of “hit” (take another card) or “stand.” 
The dealer has to follow standard blackjack rules and take a card until they reach or exceed 17 (the exception being a “soft 17” – more on that later). 
A round is over when one of the players goes “bust” (exceeds 21) or when both players have refused to take a card. 
The player closest to (but not over) 21 wins the round.
